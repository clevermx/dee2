# DEE2 Folder contents
In this folder, you will see several files:

## GeneCountMatrix.tsv     
A tab separated file of gene level expression counts generated by STAR. The different columns represent different SRA run 
accession numbers and the different columns are represented by different Ensembl genes. 

## GeneInfo.tsv
A tab separated file of ensembl genes mapped to their gene symbol as well as the length of gene, as calculated by GTFtools.
This file might be useful if you need to convert the gene IDs from accession numbers to symbols for downstream pathway analysis
or need to calculate FPKM for genes.

## logs/
A folder of logs, each file corresponding to an SRA run accession number. Logs include Fastqc stats, Skewer trimming stats, 
STAR mapping stats and Kalisto mapping stats.

## MetadataSummary.tsv     
A tab separated file containing very brief metadata about each SRA run. This includes links between the SRA run and accessions
to samples, experiments, projects and GEO accession numbers. There is a column to provide information about the quality control 
summary. Meanings behind the warnings are provided [here](https://github.com/markziemann/dee2/blob/master/qc/qc_metrics.md).
There is a column called "experiment_title" which might be useful to quickly distinguish samples into different treatment 
groups.
